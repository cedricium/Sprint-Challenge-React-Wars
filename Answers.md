1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React.js is a JavaScript library that makes building UIs easier. React attempts
to solve the tediousness of DOM manipulation by giving developers the ability to
easily integrate interactivity on a webpage.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

By thinking in React, it means to think of everything as a component. From single
elements to forms, to lists of data, everything should be thought as a reusable
module (even if it is only used once).

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Stateful components have the ability to "remember" things about the application,
be it the current filter applied or a list of todos. Like having a brain, stateful
components are smart. On the other hand, functional/presentational components do
not have the brains a stateful component has, thus, they are usually only beneficial
for pure-UI aspects of an app.

1.  Describe state.

Similar to as described above, state is the brains of a component, allowing it
to do more complex operations. State is an immutable object that acts as a mini
database for the component.

1.  Describe props.

Props are pieces of data that are passed from one component to it's child in the
form of an HTML attribute.
